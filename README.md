# Layout-with-Boostrap5

Our challenge is to build a **landing page** and make it looks as much like this design as possible.

![Desktop version](./Recursos/Dise%C3%B1o/desktop-design.jpg)

In this exercise we will start with the main part, which is the content that users see when they enter the web:

For this you will have to implement:

Fixed top navbar, using Bootstrap's "navBar" component.

The main content, using the **responsive grid provided by Bootstrap** to divide the screen into two columns, on the left as you can see is the tagline, description and buttons, and on the right column the image.

## Minimum requirements:

- Install Bootstrap in the project, don't use CDN.

- Use Bootstrap's navBar component.

- Use Bootstrap's Grid Responsive, as it should look good on tablet and mobile.

Modify with SASS, through the file you created "main.scss", the main and secondary color of Bootstrap. Use these variables for the color of the buttons

- `Main Color: #5265E1`
- `Secondary Color: #FA5959.`
